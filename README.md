We will be cruising through the following topics
- What the heck is tailwind?
- What did I build?
- How should I set up, design using tailwind!

## What the heck is tailwind?
Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override. I have taken this definition from [here](https://tailwindcss.com/).

The documentation is really beautiful, I personally finished reading documentation.

## What did I build?
Once I completed scanning the docs, the best way to check oneself is to do some project. So I decided to replicate [YouTube](https://youtube.com/). It was decent enough, took some time initially later cruised well.

The overall time consumed was (calculated using wakatime)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
